                This project involved finding an existing public webpage and (1) analyzing areas of weakness in its design,
                (2) prototyping and creating a new version of the page.

                                The LFPL website was entered into WebAIM WAVE, a site that detects possible accessibility problems.

                                WebAIM revealed that the website uses Aria labels quite effectively to help visually impaired users. In fact the only issues that the site flagged were that the page was missing an "h1" tag, and that some links were repeated on the page, so pretty minor issues.

                        As much as I'd like to share my actual figma, it is linked to my real name, so here are some screenshots.
                        I made a seperate interface for mobile that was a little less crowded, but didn't have time to implement it in my actual HTML webpage because I put so much work into the desktop version.

                    You might notice that the formatting does in fact break down when you resize the window to be super narrow on desktop. This is because I ran out of
                    time to complete my mobile prototype. However, if you go into developer settings, you will notice that the format does not break down on any of the preset devices.
                    It simply gets narrower and then resizes on ipad and mobile, which is an functional solution for now.
                    <br><br>
                    I also suggest you zoom in using ctrl+ . It does break down after a point, but since the formatting is based on REM units it holds up pretty well.
